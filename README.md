# business-site-project
Project from CodeAcademy.  Basically working to create a homepage that utilizes the flexbox property.  My subject for the webpage is creating a yoga studio site.  The site will be broken into three sections.  First section consisting of images, second section consisting of quotation, still working on what the third secion will consist of.  For sure a nod to the logo and site.
